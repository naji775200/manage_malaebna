ONBOARDING IMAGES SETUP

Please save the soccer player images to this directory with the following names:

1. onboarding1.png - First onboarding image (player dribbling)
2. onboarding2.png - Second onboarding image (player kicking)
3. onboarding3.png - Third onboarding image (player running)

The images need to be in JPG format and should be named exactly as indicated above.

After placing these images, run the following commands to ensure Flutter recognizes them:

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

Then restart your application.
