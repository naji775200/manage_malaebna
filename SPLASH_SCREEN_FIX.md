# Splash Screen Issue Fix

## Problem

After creating a splash screen with `flutter_native_splash` plugin, the Android build was failing with the following error:

```
AAPT2 aapt2-8.2.0-10154469-windows Daemon #0: Unexpected error during link, attempting to stop daemon.
This should not happen under normal circumstances, please file an issue if it does.
```

## Solution

The issue was resolved by:

1. Simplifying the Gradle build configuration to prevent AAPT2 conflicts.
2. Disabling unnecessary build optimizations that were causing issues.
3. Regenerating the splash screen with proper configuration.

### Specific Changes Made:

#### 1. Modified `android/gradle.properties`:

- Disabled parallel execution to avoid AAPT2 issues:
  ```
  org.gradle.parallel=false
  org.gradle.daemon=false
  org.gradle.caching=false
  org.gradle.configureondemand=false
  ```
- Disabled resource optimizations:
  ```
  android.enableResourceOptimizations=false
  ```
- Removed custom AAPT2 path configuration that was causing problems

#### 2. Simplified `android/app/build.gradle`:

- Simplified AAPT options:
  ```gradle
  aaptOptions {
      cruncherEnabled = false
      noCompress "webp", "webm"
  }
  ```

#### 3. Cleaned and rebuilt the project:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
flutter build apk --debug
```

## Future Maintenance

If you encounter AAPT2 issues again:

1. Try cleaning the project first:

   ```bash
   flutter clean && cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && flutter pub get
   ```

2. Check `android/gradle.properties` and ensure resource optimizations are disabled.

3. If issues persist, consider:
   - Downgrading the Android Gradle Plugin version in `android/build.gradle`
   - Increasing memory allocation for Gradle in `android/gradle.properties`
   - Using the Android Studio GUI to update the splash screen instead of the plugin

## Note on Resource Images

Ensure all image resources in the splash screen configuration:

- Are properly formatted (PNG, WebP)
- Have no special characters in filenames
- Are located in the correct directories
- Are of reasonable size (less than 1MB each)

The current configuration in `flutter_native_splash.yaml` is working correctly after these fixes.
